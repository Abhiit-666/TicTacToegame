Hereâ€™s a stepwise approach to building a real-time multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java and WebSockets:

---

### **1. Project Setup**
   - **Task 1**: Set up your Java project, adding necessary dependencies (such as WebSocket support).
   - **Task 2**: Create the server architecture to handle player connections and manage game instances.

---

### **2. WebSocket Setup for Real-time Communication**
   - **Task 3**: Implement WebSocket server endpoints to manage incoming player connections.
   - **Task 4**: Write the basic client-side WebSocket setup to connect to the server and send/receive messages.
   - **Task 5**: Test the WebSocket connection by sending simple messages from client to server and vice versa.

---

### **3. Game Lobby and Matchmaking**
   - **Task 6**: Create a lobby where players can wait until matched with an opponent.
   - **Task 7**: Implement matchmaking logic to pair two players together when both are available.
   - **Task 8**: Notify players when they are matched and ready to start a game.

---

### **4. Game Logic Implementation**
   - **Task 9**: Design the 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board as a data structure on the server (like a 2D array).
   - **Task 10**: Implement logic to check for valid moves (ensuring each cell can only be marked once).
   - **Task 11**: Add logic to alternate turns between the two players and validate the correct turn order.

---

### **5. Real-time Game State Synchronization**
   - **Task 12**: When a player makes a move, send the move to the server.
   - **Task 13**: Broadcast the updated board state to both players so they see real-time changes.
   - **Task 14**: Synchronize the game state between players after every move to ensure consistency.

---

### **6. Endgame Logic (Win/Loss/Draw)**
   - **Task 15**: Implement checks after each move to detect a win, loss, or draw.
   - **Task 16**: If a win or draw is detected, update both players and end the game session.
   - **Task 17**: Send the final game result (win/lose/draw) to each player, displaying it on the client side.

---

### **7. Handling Disconnections and Errors**
   - **Task 18**: Implement logic to handle unexpected disconnections (e.g., if one player leaves mid-game).
   - **Task 19**: Notify the remaining player and handle the end of the game session gracefully.
   - **Task 20**: Set up error handling for unexpected inputs or actions from clients.

---

### **8. Optional: Basic Chat Feature**
   - **Task 21**: Implement a chat feature to allow players to communicate during the game.
   - **Task 22**: Add a chat handler on the server and client sides to handle text messages alongside game moves.

---

### **9. Testing and Debugging**
   - **Task 23**: Test the game in different scenarios (e.g., valid and invalid moves, win/loss conditions, disconnections).
   - **Task 24**: Run performance and load tests to ensure the server handles concurrent connections well.

---

### **10. Deployment**
   - **Task 25**: Set up a cloud server (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.) to host the WebSocket server.
   - **Task 26**: Deploy the server and test it with real players to ensure everything runs smoothly.
