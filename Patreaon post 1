### **Real-Time Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe Game Development: Setting Up Player Connections and Matchmaking**

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm thrilled to share my latest progress on building a real-time multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game! So far, Iâ€™ve set up the core parts that handle **player connections**, **WebSocket communication**, and **matchmaking**. Hereâ€™s a look into whatâ€™s been accomplished!

---

### **1. Server Setup and WebSocket Communication**

To manage real-time interaction, I started by building a WebSocket server using **Java**. This setup allows multiple players to connect and enables the server to communicate with each player in real-time. Hereâ€™s how itâ€™s structured:

- **GameManager**: This core component manages player connections and pairs players into matches. It tracks waiting players, active games, and smoothly transitions players from the waiting room into a game.
- **Game and Player Classes**: These classes represent each game instance and player session. The `Game` class manages the game board, turn order, and holds references to the players involved.

This setup means that the server can now efficiently handle multiple players, organizing them into matches and maintaining active games!

> **Image Suggestion**: Include a diagram of the server structure, showing how the `GameManager`, `Game`, and `Player` classes connect to WebSocket sessions.

### **2. Connecting Players and Matchmaking**

After setting up WebSocket communication, I focused on connecting players and implementing matchmaking. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **Player Connections**: When a player connects to the server, theyâ€™re added to a waiting list if there isnâ€™t already another player ready to play.
- **Pairing Players**: As soon as two players are available, theyâ€™re matched and placed into a new game instance.
- **Handling Waiting and Active Games**: Once paired, players are removed from the waiting list and placed into the active game list, ensuring that only unpaired players remain in the waiting room.

Now, players can connect to the server, be paired automatically, and start a game session together. This functionality creates the foundation for multiplayer gameplay!

> **Video Suggestion**: Show a short demo video of two clients connecting, being matched, and notified when their game is ready.

### **Challenges and Solutions**

One interesting challenge was **handling simultaneous connections** and ensuring players were correctly matched. To solve this, I set up the `GameManager` to manage each playerâ€™s session carefully, tracking waiting players and starting games as soon as a pair is available. This setup keeps everything organized and ensures no players are left hanging!

### **Whatâ€™s Next?**

With the player connections and matchmaking set up, the next steps will be:
- **Game State Management**: Developing the Tic-Tac-Toe board and ensuring moves are valid.
- **Turn Handling**: Setting up alternate turns between players.
- **Real-time Updates**: Broadcasting moves so both players see the board update instantly.

> **Poll Suggestion**: If you'd like feedback, you could add a poll here asking if followers are interested in a technical breakdown of the matchmaking process.

Thank you for being part of this journey! Itâ€™s been exciting to see this multiplayer game take shape, and I canâ€™t wait to share more as the gameplay comes together. Stay tuned for the next update, and feel free to drop any questions or ideas in the comments! ðŸ˜Š
